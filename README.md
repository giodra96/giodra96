👋 Hi, I’m @giodra96

👀 I'm interested in AI & Data Science, particularly focusing on Data Engineering.
🌱 I'm currently learning various tools and frameworks such as Spark, Airflow, and Kafka!

💡 Fun fact: I started my career with data back in high school, but then shifted my focus to management engineering because I wasn't fully passionate about development. However, as they say, some loves never truly fade away, and now I find myself drawn back to the world of data.
